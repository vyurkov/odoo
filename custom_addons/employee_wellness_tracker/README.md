Challenges and Solutions
---------------------------------------

### Challenge 1: Data Integrity and Validation
Problem: Ensuring that the data entered for wellness activities is valid and makes sense.
Solution: Implement constraints and validation checks in your model.

### Challenge 2: Performance Optimization
Problem: As the data grows, the list view of wellness activities might become slow, especially if it contains many records.
Solution: Optimize the view by implementing pagination, limiting the default fetched records, and using indexes on frequently searched fields.

### Challenge 4: User Accessibility and Permissions
Problem: Managing who has the access to create, read, update, or delete wellness activities, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform certain actions.
Solution: Define detailed access control lists (ACLs) and record rules. In Odoo, this is managed through the XML or CSV files where you define access rights.
